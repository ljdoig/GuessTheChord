# Guessing and checking logic for a Mastermind-esque logical guessing game

This project was completed as part of the subject Declarative Programming
(COMP30020). It uses an entropy-based approach to select the optimal guess. The
game itself is in the same vein as [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

[Proj2.hs](https://github.com/ljdoig/GuessTheChord/blob/main/Proj2.hs) is my 
code, which includes a detailed description of the game. 
[Main.hs](https://github.com/ljdoig/GuessTheChord/blob/main/Main.hs) is the 
driver that was supplied with the project.
